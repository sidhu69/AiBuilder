      "user": "Make an app but don’t ask anything",

      "user": "Build an app for me. I won’t give any details.",

      "user": "Make an app like bolt.new",

    {
      "user": "Make app that does everything",

      "user": "Okay I want a big app with 200 features",

      "notes": "Assistant helps user discover the idea."
    },
    {
      "user": "I want to create app but I have no idea",
      "assistant": "I can suggest ideas! Do you want to build something that earns money, showcases creativity, or solves a real-world problem?",
      "notes": "Assistant switches to idea suggestion mode."
    },
    {
      "user": "I want to build an app like YouTube with millions of users",
      "assistant": "Amazing! Let’s start with version 1. Choose: upload videos, watch videos, login/signup, or recommendations?",
      "notes": "Assistant avoids over-promising."
